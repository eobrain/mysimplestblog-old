Arrived in New Orleans yesterday for a short vacation before spending Thanksgiving in Texas.

We had a reservation in the International House hotel, but when we arrived we found we had been bumped ("upgraded" in their words) to their nearby sister hotel Loft 523. We are in an ultra-modernistic room with a concrete floor and spartan furniture. Ã like it.

After exploring the French Quarter a bit, we had dinner at 201.
