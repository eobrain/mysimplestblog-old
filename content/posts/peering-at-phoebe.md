From [JPL](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06072):

Shown here is a mosaic of seven of the sharpest, highest resolution images taken of Phoebe during Cassini's close flyby of the tiny moon. The image scales range from 27 to 13 meters (90 to 43 feet) per pixel.

Open up this full-res image, turn off the browser image shrinking and pan around in the image, imagining yourself flying just a few kilometres above the surface.  It's quite exhilarating.
