As an experiment, I'm seeing if I can use a navigational metaphor in which the articles in this blog are arranged left to right.  To reinforce the metaphor I added some CSS animation that slides the page sideways when you click between articles. I also changed the index page to list the articles in the blog in a horizontal carousel.  It's still pretty crude visually.
