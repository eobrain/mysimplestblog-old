Mastodon is great, but sometimes you want to write something long form without having to split it up into 500 character chunks. And sometimes you want a modicum of control over the formatting.

Now there is a new potential for a rebirth of the venerable blog form to complement Mastodon, while still being integrated with it in the larger Fediverse of federated servers.

This blog is an example. On Mastodon you can follow it by searching for

```
eob@eamonn.org
```

and clicking the Follow button. Then all future posts here will appear in your Mastodon feed.

(I'm still in the progress of converting over posts from the [previous version of this blog][1], so you may see a bunch of metadata clutter the beginning of the older posts.)
