[http://obrain.com/~eob/blogPics/historySpace2.gif] I have been working on a little project that involves data mining some personal history. One of the things I have been trying is using principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of my data to something I can get an intuitive feel for, so that I can try to ficure out what are the best automated methods for pattern recognition.  This image is an example reduced from sixteen variables to three.  It's impressive what you can do in Mathematica.
