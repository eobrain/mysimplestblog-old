From [Computer Magazine - In Defense of PowerPoint](https://web.archive.org/web/20040806051229/http://www.computer.org/computer/homepage/0704/profession/index.htm) comes an interesting approach to giving conference presentations:


>
conference presenters who merely recapitulate the contents of their paper place themselves in danger of putting their audience to sleep, particularly straight after lunch. A more effective approach uses the presentation to persuade the majority of the audience to actually read the paper, then devotes the question time to those few who have already read it.


and how to use bullet points:


>
Bullet points—PowerPoint's most vilified aspect—are the most misunderstood of presentation techniques. As far as the audience is concerned, bullet points only serve to remind them of the presentation's general context. As far as the presenter is concerned, bullet points replace the mnemonic techniques handed down from the Greeks and the more recent prompt cards hidden in the hand of a formal debater.


I am not sure that Tufte would agree.
