Jamie Beckett at HP Labs has [a blog entry](https://web.archive.org/web/20090301012922/http://www.communities.hp.com:80/online/blogs/labsblog/archive/2008/07/09/free-automatic-photo-enhancement.aspx) on [one of the Snapfish Lab tools](https://web.archive.org/web/20120402045825/http://www.snapfishlab.com/PublicAboutPhotoTool.do?tool=HIPIE) which automatically applies seven proprietary enhancement algorithms to improve your photograph.  See [Jamie's article](https://web.archive.org/web/20090301012922/http://www.communities.hp.com:80/online/blogs/labsblog/archive/2008/07/09/free-automatic-photo-enhancement.aspx) for more information.

(Disclosure: I was the architect for Snapfish Lab when it was launched, and still help out with it.)
