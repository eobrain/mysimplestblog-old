[Transit of Venus][1]

Not surprisingly, HP Labs has many astronomy geeks, and after photographing my own modest Venus image I came around the other side of the building to find a crowd had gathered around several large telescopes, including one that was projecting this dinner-plate sized image of the Sun on a borrowed whiteboard. In addition to Venus, note the sunspots in the bottom left.
