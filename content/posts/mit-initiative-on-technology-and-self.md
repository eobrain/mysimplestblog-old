I am currently listening to a Cambridge Forum speech by Sherry Turkle on our local public radio station. She is the director of the MIT initiative on technology and self.

Interesting stuff. She is talking about the reality and implications of people forming emotional attachments to computation devices ("relational artifacts") like robot pets and dolls. I wonder how much this extends to the ubiquitous computation world that we are exploring in our research?
