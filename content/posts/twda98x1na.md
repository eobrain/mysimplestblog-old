For the last few months, I have been part of the team creating [Snapfish Lab](https://web.archive.org/web/20120703054908/http://www.snapfishlab.com/), a web site that allows users of the HP’s Snapfish photo site to try out some of the new technology coming out of HP Labs.

In its current form it is fairly modest -- we have a few tools and let you play with them using your own Snapfish photos – but if we get sufficient interest we will be expanding it to show off all the cool new stuff we have waiting in the wings.

Feel free to go to the site and try using the tools with the sample photographs provided.  We are still not fully open to the public, but I have some pre-release invitation codes available that I can give out to the first few people who add comments to this blog entry.
