There has been a lot of irresponsible reporting of the possible dangers from the damaged Japanese nuclear reactors.  Even the New York Times was guilty of providing [an interactive presentation](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/03/16/science/plume-graphic.html) that gave a misleading impression that the U.S. West Coast was in danger.

Here is one piece of sanity that I urge you to study if you have any concerns about your risks from radiation.
