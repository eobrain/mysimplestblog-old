I'm writing this post in #WriteFreely a blogging platform that allows blogs to be followed and posts to be boosted on Mastodon.

## Formatting

Mastodon only handles plain text, so the examples below probably won't appear properly there.

WriteFreely allows for formatting such as

1. *italics* 
2.  **bold**
3. lists like this
   * including
   * nested
   * lists
4. headers like "Formatting" above
5. `console.log("inline code segments")`

> You can also block-quote text like this.

```javascript
console.log("Or you can add code blocks")
console.log("like this.")
```

## Linking

You can also embed images

![SFO][1]

and [links to arbitrary pages][2].

## Length

WriteFreely posts can be arbitrarily long, as compared to Mastodon's limit of 500 characters.

* **Update**: This is what the above part of the post looks like on Mastodon:*

*Note, that the post is truncated so it is not longer than a typical Mastodon post. When you click the "Read more" it expands out to the following.*

*As expected, formatting like italics and bold are omitted, but the biggest loss is that embedded images are not shown.*
