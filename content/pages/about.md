I'm Ã‰amonn, a software engineering manager working on privacy UI at a Big Tech company.

My team's aim is to increase transparency and controls of user data, giving users more agency over their privacy. We are able to this thanks to robust privacy law enforcement in some jurisdictions, which ensures our work is a company priority. We also go beyond mere compliance and are guided by UX research on what are users' actual privacy needs and expectations.

One particular interest for mine is finding ways to protect vulnerable people who could be seriously harmed by the wrong people seeing their data.

I've longed believed that the UX problem of privacy is one of the hardest problems in software. I think we are finally making some progress.

And as a manager, I find great engineers who understand the privacy issues and support them as they grow in their careers.
